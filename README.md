# FastAPI Beginner's Guide

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share essential insights and learnings about FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## FastAPI Overview

- **Introduction:** [Watch this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykeT6kk4bk) for an introduction to FastAPI. FastAPI simplifies the process of building APIs by leveraging Python's type system to automatically generate interactive API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc.
  
- **Key Concepts:** FastAPI supports various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowing you to handle different types of requests and responses efficiently.
  
- **Path Parameters:** Define endpoints with path parameters to capture variable parts of the URL, making your API endpoints dynamic and versatile.
  
- **POST Request Methods:** Handle POST requests to create or submit data to your API, enabling clients to send data to the server for processing.
  
- **PUT Methods:** Use PUT requests to update existing resources or entities in your API, allowing clients to modify specific data.

## Beginner's Guide

This repository serves as a beginner's guide to FastAPI, providing simple explanations and examples to help you get started with building powerful APIs.

### Key Parameters:

- **Path Parameters:** Path parameters are variables in the URL path, enclosed in curly braces, that capture specific values from the client's request URL. For example, `/items/{item_id}` captures the value of `item_id` from the URL.
  
- **POST Request Methods:** POST requests are used to submit data to the server. In FastAPI, you can define POST endpoints using the `@app.post` decorator, specifying the endpoint path and request body model.
  
- **PUT Methods:** PUT requests are used to update existing resources. In FastAPI, you can define PUT endpoints similar to POST endpoints, but with the `@app.put` decorator.

Feel free to explore this repository to deepen your understanding of FastAPI and start building your own APIs. Happy coding! ðŸš€
